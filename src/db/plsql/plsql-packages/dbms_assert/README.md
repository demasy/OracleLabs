# DBMS_ASSERT

**DBMS_ASSERT** is a built-in Oracle PL/SQL package designed to protect against SQL injection by validating and cleaning up user inputs, especially in dynamic SQL. It includes a set of functions that check whether inputs are valid schema names, object names, SQL identifiers, and literals, ensuring only legitimate values are used in SQL queries. This helps safeguard the database from malicious input and ensures data integrity.
